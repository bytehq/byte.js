### Status

Very early. Here's a quick list of what's left to do:

- `Music` object
- Sound on `Video` objects
- Color fills on `Graphic` objects
- Text wrapping on Links
- Effects
- Unit tests
- ~~Retina support~~
- ~~Text rendering for `Text` and `Paragraph` is missing several fonts and behaves oddly in certain scenarios~~
- ~~Opacity for all objects~~
